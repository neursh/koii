# Koii
A funny little tool to handle authentication and OAuth2 provider for my projects.

This auth server would allow people to use my projects without having to create an account on each of my future projects.

While at it, I'll make it available to third-party services to use Koii as an OAuth2 method without tracking and use it for advertisement, ensuring user's privacy.
